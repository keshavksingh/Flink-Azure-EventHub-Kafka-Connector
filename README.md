# Azure EventHub Kafka Connector For Flink 
This is a FLINK 1.16 Compiled **Scala** 2.12.7 Repository. Apache Flink is a distributed big data stream processor with powerful stateful event processing. Apache Kafka is an open source event streaming message queue platform providing rich event persistence, processing semantics. Kafka can be configured as an IaaS service on Azure HDInsight (https://tinyurl.com/229yz8sa), and as a Third Party Offering from Confluent (https://tinyurl.com/37adha6e). Azure has its native 1st Party offering for Event Processing, **Azure EventHub**. (https://tinyurl.com/32nbh87m,https://tinyurl.com/2s3pr6yf)
Based on the conceptual mapping it offers rich Kafka Connect as a SaaS service. This largely minimizes managing a Kafka platform.

**This repo is a simple SCALA project demostrating streaming and consuming messages from Azure EventHub via the Kafka protocols, streaming (transforming) them with Powerful Flink engine and writing it to EventHub Producers again via Kafka Protocols. Compiled on the lastest version of Flink 1.16 this essentially is the most latest implementation demostrating open-source stream processing on Azure Cloud Paradigm.**
